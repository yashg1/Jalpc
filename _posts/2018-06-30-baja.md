## Introduction
{: .alert .alert-info}

The RoadRunners is an engineering project team which designs, builds and races off road vehicles for BAJA SAE collegiate competition. The competition is broken down into *static events* and *dynamic events*. Static events consist of design, cost report, sales presentation and technical inspection. Dynamic events comprise of maneuverability course, an acceleration track and a hill climb. At the ends, there is a 4 hour endurance race, where participating teams race together.



## Motivation
{: .alert .alert-info}

> **Spacecrafts fascinate me, especially mission control and the team celebration after a successful launch. BAJA SAE provided an opportunity to live this experience: develop a design into a product under engineering and resource constraints through team effort. The stakes were high since the car simply had to get built! Period.**

BAJA SAE was my first opportunity to be a part of the complete product development cycle - design, build and test through collective collaboration. It was an exciting and daunting time since this was a *startup* - we were the first team from our college. It provided an opportunity to approach engineering problems from *cost, sales and ergonomics* point of view. A typical day would comprise of SolidWorks FEA simulation of gears, selecting flux for MIG welding, coordinating logistics to import transmission components and fundraising.

## Challenges faced
{: .alert .alert-info}

I faced and navigated challenges which all organizations encounter. BAJA SAE has been the most challenging (*consequently, most memorable*) experience till date

1. Money! (like most startups, we engaged in extensive fundraising efforts)

2. Conformance to BAJA SAE design rules and SAE safety standards (*Eg: no engine modifications, top speed limit, fuel inlet design, rollcage material testing* )

3. Vendor engagement

4. Team dynamics

5. Design for X (X: cost, weight, performance, endurance)

6. Recruit and mentor the next generation to ensure continuity

## Highlights
{: .alert .alert-info}

* Only first time team to use [Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission)

* Successfully completed 4 hour long endurance race

* Secured 65/120 teams and 22/48 for first time teams
