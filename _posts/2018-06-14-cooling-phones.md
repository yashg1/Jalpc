Duration: August 2014 - December 2016  
Course: MS Thesis Research

# Introduction
Electronic devices keep getting more powerful and smaller in size. The temperature limits for reliable operation of the materials used to make phones (*Ex: Silicon used in processor*) have not changed. For reliable operation, the processor temperature should be $$ < \range{80}{120} $$°C. Hence, cooling solutions play a vital role in device performance.

## Why Phase Change Materials?
Cooling a mobile phone implies developing a thermal management solution with these constraints:
1. The outer case or surface temperature of the phone should be $$ <40 $$°C for user comfort
2. The processor temperature should be $$ <80 $$ °C for reliable operation
