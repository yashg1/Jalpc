Summarizing, the cooling solution should move or spread the heat from a smaller surface area (processor) to a larger surface area (outer surface of phone) for the heat to be dissipated out to the ambient while ensuring that the user can hold the phone at all times. In addition, the cooling solution should be able to respond to short duration, sharp spikes in power consumption ($$\approx 10\times$$ Thermal Design Power).

## Why not Phase Change Materials
As promising as the ability to absorb heat while keeping the temperature pinned around the melting point sounds, this heat still needs to be dissipated to the ambient. This is challenging because most PCMs (*such as candle wax*) are poor heat conductors compared to copper, a common heat spreader (thermal conductivity is $$ 100 \times $$ lower). The temperature of PCM increases like other materials if it absorbs heat before or after phase change (*i.e. if the temperature is not close to the melting point*).
