| Questions      | Work Done         |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| How to compare different thermal solutions?         |   {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> Reviewed literature </li><li> Surveyed thermal engineers in the industry</li></ul>{:/} Identified cutoff time - time taken to reach cutoff temperature (*Cutoff temperature is the temperature after which throttling begins to lower device performance*)|
|   What are the key design parameters?         |    {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Integration location of the PCM: on the processor or near the surface </li><li>Weight/Volume of PCM required </li><li>Processor power profile (*power vs time curve*) </li></ul>{:/}|
|  What are the critical material properties?         |    {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> Thermal conductivity </li><li> Latent Heat </li>     <li> Melting Point (Transition Temperature) </li></ul>{:/} Characterized thermal conductivity using reference bar method (*ASTM D5470 standard*) with Infra-Red (IR) camera       |
|How do they influence the key design parameters?| Analyzed the effect of material properties, PCM weight and integration location on the cutoff time by       {::nomarkdown} <ul><li> Performing stress tests with PCM on the processor of a Thermal Test Vehicle   </li><li> Developed phone and processor level heat transfer simulations in COMSOL & ANSYS ICEPAK </li> <li> Performed Uncertainty Ananlysis (Parametric sweep) to determine critical properties </li> </ul> {:/}|
