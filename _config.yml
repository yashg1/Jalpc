        "Persevering mechanical engineer who enjoys turning designs into products through efficient collaboration and programming. I love managing heat - currently, I develop products to measure heat by converting it into electrical signals (thermocouples).
        Previously, I worked on cooling smartphones and storing solar energy. In my free time, I learn Machine Learning and new languages (currently learning Mandarin: HSK Level 2). \n
        Also, I helped build my university's first SAE BAJA car in 2013"
