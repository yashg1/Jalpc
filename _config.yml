        Welcome to my website! I am a persevering and multifaceted mechanical engineer who enjoys turning designs into products through efficient collaboration.
        With experience in CAD, heat transfer, CFD, programing and hardware testing/troubleshooting, I can take on a variety of challenging roles. I like to keep learning and playing with the greatest and latest. Also, I helped build a car!
        I love soccer âš½, ðŸ“– and learning languages (current ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³).
